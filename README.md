# Tubular
An app for planning journeys on the London underground.

## Description
The front end of Tubular is an app built using React. This is a continuation of an earlier group project which can be found at https://github.com/iO-Academy/2022-mar-london-underground-fe. I've modified it to allow display of journeys where a change is necessary, along with some minor stylistic tweaks.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:iO-Academy/2022-mar-london-underground-fe.git
```
2. Install and run London undergound backend.

   Follow the instructions at: [https://github.com/iO-Academy/2022-mar-london-underground-be](https://github.com/AndrewScott85/london-underground-be-continuation)

## Set Up the App
3. Open a terminal emulator (such as Terminal) and navigate to the directory, e.g.:
```bash
cd 2022-mar-london-underground-fe
npm install
```
## Run the Application
4. In the terminal emulator, navigate into the frontend directory. Start the frontend app with:
```bash
npm start
```
5. Start the backend API.

6. Tubular page will be available at http://localhost:3000

## Terminating the Application
The app can be stopped from the terminal emulator by pressing Control-C in its tab.
